rroshdy11: its about oop concepts

GitHub Copilot: The provided Python code snippet demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, specifically encapsulation and polymorphism, through the definition and use of classes and methods.

1. **Encapsulation** is showcased by defining classes [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") (though their full definitions are not shown) that encapsulate the properties and behaviors of circles and rectangles, respectively. These classes likely have private attributes (e.g., [`__length`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A276%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py"), [`__width`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A277%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py") for [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and a radius for [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py")) and public methods ([`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py")) to calculate their area and perimeter. The use of double underscores (`__`) in Python indicates that an attribute is intended to be private, restricting access to it from outside the class.

2. **Polymorphism** is demonstrated through the use of a common interface (methods with the same name) in different classes. Both [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") classes have [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") methods, but each class implements these methods differently to suit their specific shapes. This allows for the methods to be called in the same way on objects of either class, as seen in the print statements, showcasing polymorphism's ability to process objects differently depending on their class.

The code snippet ends with the beginning of another class definition for [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py"), indicating a shift to another example or concept, likely continuing the demonstration of OOP principles such as encapsulation with private attributes ([`__name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A301%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py") and presumably `__age`).

This example is useful for understanding how OOP principles can be applied in Python to create well-structured, reusable, and scalable code.

rroshdy11: add that I talked about methods types and Dunder methods and how to make parameters private and public and inhertance 

GitHub Copilot: The provided Python code snippet illustrates several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including method types, dunder (double underscore) methods, encapsulation through private and public parameters, and hints at inheritance. Here's a breakdown of these concepts as demonstrated or implied in the snippet:

1. **Method Types**:
    - **Instance Methods**: The [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") methods within the classes are instance methods since they operate on an instance of the class (e.g., [`self`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py")) and are called on an instance object (e.g., [`circle.area()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A286%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "main.py")).

2. **Dunder Methods**:
    - The [`__init__`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A300%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") method is a dunder (double underscore) method, also known as a magic method. It's used for class instantiation. This method allows for the initialization of an object's attributes at the time of its creation. Although not shown for [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py"), it's demonstrated in the [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") class, initializing [`__name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A301%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py") and presumably `__age`.

3. **Encapsulation with Private and Public Parameters**:
    - **Private Attributes**: Attributes prefixed with double underscores, like [`__name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A301%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py") in the [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") class, are private. This means they are intended to be accessed only within the class they are defined, not from outside or by subclasses, enforcing a level of security and data hiding.
    - **Public Attributes**: Attributes without the double underscore prefix are considered public, meaning they can be freely accessed from outside the class. The code snippet primarily demonstrates private attributes, but public attributes would not use the double underscore prefix.

4. **Inheritance** (Implied):
    - While the code snippet does not directly demonstrate inheritance, the concept is a fundamental part of OOP. Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass), promoting code reuse. For example, if there were a `Person` class, [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") could potentially inherit from it, gaining access to `Person`'s attributes and methods while also defining its own.

5. **Polymorphism** (Implied in Discussion):
    - Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. This is implied through the use of [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") methods in both [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") classes, where the methods perform calculations specific to the shape of the object.

This explanation expands on the initial discussion, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the OOP concepts demonstrated and implied in the Python code snippet.

rroshdy11: add about abstraction and make the methods type and dunder methods the last points

GitHub Copilot: To address the request, I'll first outline the steps to modify the provided code snippet to include abstraction and then rearrange the methods to make type and dunder methods the last points:

1. **Introduce Abstraction**: We'll create an abstract class named `Shape` that includes abstract methods [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py"). This ensures that any shape we create (like [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") or [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py")) must implement these methods.

2. **Modify Existing Classes**: Modify the [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") classes to inherit from the `Shape` class and implement the abstract methods [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py").

3. **Rearrange Methods**: Ensure that any type or dunder methods in the [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py"), [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py"), and [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") classes are placed at the end of the class definition.

4. **Implement Type and Dunder Methods**: If not already present, add a `__str__` method to the [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") class as an example of a dunder method, and place it at the end of the class definition.

Here's how the modified code might look:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class Shape
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

# Circle class inheriting from Shape
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.__radius * self.__radius

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14 * self.__radius

# Rectangle class inheriting from Shape
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.__length = length
        self.__width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.__length * self.__width

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.__length + self.__width)

# More Examples for Dunder Methods
class Man:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age

    # Example of a dunder method
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Man[name={self.__name}, age={self.__age}]"

circle = Circle(5)
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 10)

print(f"Circle Area: {circle.area()}")
print(f"Circle Perimeter: {circle.perimeter()}")
print(f"Rectangle Area: {rectangle.area()}")
print(f"Rectangle Perimeter: {rectangle.perimeter()}")
```

This code introduces an abstract class `Shape` to demonstrate abstraction, ensuring that both `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes provide implementations for `area` and `perimeter` methods. The `Man` class is updated to include a dunder method `__str__`, showcasing how to implement and order dunder methods within a class.

rroshdy11: I mean here add about abstraction and make the methods type and dunder methods the last points The provided Python code snippet illustrates several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including method types, dunder (double underscore) methods, encapsulation through private and public parameters, and hints at inheritance. Here's a breakdown of these concepts as demonstrated or implied in the snippet:

Method Types:

Instance Methods: The area and perimeter methods within the classes are instance methods since they operate on an instance of the class (e.g., self) and are called on an instance object (e.g., circle.area()).
Dunder Methods:

The __init__ method is a dunder (double underscore) method, also known as a magic method. It's used for class instantiation. This method allows for the initialization of an object's attributes at the time of its creation. Although not shown for Circle and Rectangle, it's demonstrated in the Man class, initializing __name and presumably __age.
Encapsulation with Private and Public Parameters:

Private Attributes: Attributes prefixed with double underscores, like __name in the Man class, are private. This means they are intended to be accessed only within the class they are defined, not from outside or by subclasses, enforcing a level of security and data hiding.
Public Attributes: Attributes without the double underscore prefix are considered public, meaning they can be freely accessed from outside the class. The code snippet primarily demonstrates private attributes, but public attributes would not use the double underscore prefix.
Inheritance (Implied):

While the code snippet does not directly demonstrate inheritance, the concept is a fundamental part of OOP. Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass), promoting code reuse. For example, if there were a Person class, Man could potentially inherit from it, gaining access to Person's attributes and methods while also defining its own.
Polymorphism (Implied in Discussion):

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. This is implied through the use of area and perimeter methods in both Circle and Rectangle classes, where the methods perform calculations specific to the shape of the object.
This explanation expands on the initial discussion, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the OOP concepts demonstrated and implied in the Python code snippet.

GitHub Copilot: The provided Python code snippet illustrates several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including method types, dunder (double underscore) methods, encapsulation through private and public parameters, and hints at inheritance. Here's a breakdown of these concepts as demonstrated or implied in the snippet:

1. **Method Types**:
   - **Instance Methods**: The [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") methods within the classes are instance methods since they operate on an instance of the class (e.g., [`self`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py")) and are called on an instance object (e.g., [`circle.area()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A286%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "main.py")).

2. **Dunder Methods**:
   - The [`__init__`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A300%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") method is a dunder (double underscore) method, also known as a magic method. It's used for class instantiation. This method allows for the initialization of an object's attributes at the time of its creation. Although not shown for [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py"), it's demonstrated in the [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") class, initializing [`__name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A301%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py") and presumably `__age`.

3. **Encapsulation with Private and Public Parameters**:
   - **Private Attributes**: Attributes prefixed with double underscores, like [`__name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A301%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "main.py") in the [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") class, are private. This means they are intended to be accessed only within the class they are defined, not from outside or by subclasses, enforcing a level of security and data hiding.
   - **Public Attributes**: Attributes without the double underscore prefix are considered public, meaning they can be freely accessed from outside the class. The code snippet primarily demonstrates private attributes, but public attributes would not use the double underscore prefix.

4. **Inheritance (Implied)**:
   - While the code snippet does not directly demonstrate inheritance, the concept is a fundamental part of OOP. Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass), promoting code reuse. For example, if there were a `Person` class, [`Man`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A299%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") could potentially inherit from it, gaining access to `Person`'s attributes and methods while also defining its own.

5. **Polymorphism (Implied in Discussion)**:
   - Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. This is implied through the use of [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") methods in both [`Circle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A264%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") and [`Rectangle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A274%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D "main.py") classes, where the methods perform calculations specific to the shape of the object.

6. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction is hinted at through the use of instance methods that hide the complexity of calculations from the user. For example, the [`area`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A279%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") and [`perimeter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Frrosh%2FDesktop%2FOOP%20With%20Python%2Fmain.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A282%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "main.py") methods provide a simple interface to complex operations, allowing the user to obtain this information without knowing the formula.

This explanation expands on the initial discussion, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the OOP concepts demonstrated and implied in the Python code snippet.

rroshdy11: $ git commit -m "first commit"
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'rrosh@Reda.(none)')


GitHub Copilot: To resolve the issue, you need to set your Git user name and email address because Git embeds this information into each commit. This is how you're identified as the author of the changes. You can set these globally on your machine or specifically for the current repository. The error message suggests setting them globally, which means your user name and email will be used for any Git repository you work with on your machine.

Here's how you can set your Git user name and email globally:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run the following commands, replacing `"Your Name"` with your actual name and `"you@example.com"` with your actual email address. These should be the name and email you want associated with your Git commits.

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

After setting these, you should be able to commit without encountering the author identity unknown error.

rroshdy11: How can I check my Git user name and email configuration?

GitHub Copilot: To check your Git user name and email configuration, you can use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

These commands will display the global user name and email address configured for Git on your machine.

rroshdy11: How can I configure my Git user name and email locally for a specific repository?

GitHub Copilot: To configure your Git user name and email locally for a specific repository, you need to run the `git config` command without the `--global` flag from within the repository's directory. This sets the configuration only for the current repository and overrides the global configuration for this repository only.

1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to your repository's directory using the `cd` command.
3. Run the following commands, replacing `"Your Name"` and `"you@example.com"` with your desired local user name and email address:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"
```

This configuration will apply only to the repository you are currently in.
