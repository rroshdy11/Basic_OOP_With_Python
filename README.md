# Overview of OOP Concepts in Python Code Snippet

The provided Python code snippet demonstrates several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including method types, dunder (double underscore) methods, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Below is a detailed breakdown of these concepts as demonstrated or implied in the snippet.

## Class and Instance Attributes

Class attributes are variables that are part of a class and shared by all instances. They are defined outside of any method and accessed using the class name. Instance attributes are variables that are part of an instance and unique to each instance.

```python
class Student:
    school = "University of Toronto"  # Class attribute
    no_of_students = 0

    def __init__(self, name, age=0, courses='none'):
        self.__name = name  # Private instance attribute
        self.__age = age  # Private instance attribute
        self.__courses = courses  # Private instance attribute
        Student.no_of_students += 1
```

## Method Types

### Instance Methods

Instance methods operate on an instance of the class and can access the instance attributes. They take `self` as a parameter.

```python
class Student:
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.__name} is {self.__age} years old and is taking {self.__courses}"

    def set_age(self, age):
        self.__age = age

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age
```

### Class Methods

Class methods are bound to the class rather than the object. They take `cls` as a parameter and are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.

```python
class Student:
    @classmethod
    def get_no_of_students(cls):
        return cls.no_of_students

    @classmethod
    def init_from_birth_year(cls, name, birth_year, courses='none'):
        return cls(name, date.today().year - birth_year, courses)
```

### Static Methods

Static methods are not bound to the class or the object. They do not take `self` or `cls` as a parameter and are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.

```python
class Student:
    @staticmethod
    def is_adult(age):
        return age > 18
```

## Dunder Methods

Dunder methods (also known as magic methods) have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. They are automatically called by Python when certain operations are performed and can be overridden to define custom behavior.

```python
class Student:
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.__name} is {self.__age} years old and is taking {self.__courses}"

    def __repr__(self):
        return "Student('{}', {})".format(self.__name, self.__age)
```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation restricts access to certain attributes or methods, typically using private attributes (prefixed with double underscores). It promotes data hiding and security.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age=0, courses='none'):
        self.__name = name  # Private attribute
        self.__age = age  # Private attribute
        self.__courses = courses  # Private attribute
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass), promoting code reuse.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age

class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.__salary = salary
```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. This is often achieved through method overriding.

```python
class Teacher(Person):
    def display(self):
        return f"{super().display()} and earns {self.__salary} per year"
```

## Abstraction

Abstraction hides the complexity of code and provides a simple interface. Abstract base classes (ABCs) and methods can be used to define a blueprint for other classes.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass
```

## Code Examples

### Student Class

```python
from datetime import date

class Student:
    school = "University of Toronto"
    no_of_students = 0

    def __init__(self, name, age=0, courses='none'):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age
        self.__courses = courses
        Student.no_of_students += 1

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.__name} is {self.__age} years old and is taking {self.__courses}"

    def __repr__(self):
        return "Student('{}', {})".format(self.__name, self.__age)

    def set_age(self, age):
        self.__age = age

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age

    @classmethod
    def get_no_of_students(cls):
        return cls.no_of_students

    @classmethod
    def init_from_birth_year(cls, name, birth_year, courses='none'):
        return cls(name, date.today().year - birth_year, courses)

    @staticmethod
    def is_adult(age):
        return age > 18

# Create an object of the class
student_1 = Student("Alice", 8)
student_2 = Student("Bob", 21, ["CSC108", "CSC148", "CSC165"])

print(student_1.get_name())
student_1.set_name("Alice Smith")
print(student_1.get_name())

print(student_1)
print(student_2)

student_3 = Student.init_from_birth_year("Charlie", 2000, ["CSC108", "CSC148", "CSC165"])
print(student_3)

print(f"Number of students: {Student.get_no_of_students()}")
print(Student.is_adult(20))
```

### Person and Teacher Classes

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age

    def set_name(self, name):
        self.__name = name

    def set_age(self, age):
        self.__age = age

    def display(self):
        return f"{self.__name} is {self.__age} years old"

class Teacher(Person):
    no_of_teachers = 0

    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.__salary = salary
        Teacher.no_of_teachers += 1

    def get_salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    def set_salary(self, salary):
        self.__salary = salary

    def display(self):
        return f"{super().display()} and earns {self.__salary} per year"

teacher_1 = Teacher("Alice", 30, 60000)
teacher_2 = Teacher("Bob", 40, 70000)

print(teacher_1.display())
print(teacher_2.display())
print(f"Number of teachers: {Teacher.no_of_teachers()}")
```
