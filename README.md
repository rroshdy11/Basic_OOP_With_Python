## Overview of OOP Concepts in Python Code Snippet

The provided Python code snippet demonstrates several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including method types, dunder (double underscore) methods, encapsulation, and hints at inheritance. Below is a detailed breakdown of these concepts as demonstrated or implied in the snippet:

### Method Types

- **Instance Methods**: The `area` and `perimeter` methods within the classes are instance methods. They operate on an instance of the class (e.g., `self`) and are called on an instance object (e.g., `circle.area()`).

### Dunder Methods

- **`__init__` Method**: The `__init__` method is a dunder method (also known as a magic method) used for class instantiation. It initializes an object's attributes at the time of its creation. Although not shown for `Circle` and `Rectangle`, it's demonstrated in the `Man` class, initializing `__name` and presumably `__age`.

### Encapsulation with Private and Public Parameters

- **Private Attributes**: Attributes prefixed with double underscores (e.g., `__name` in the `Man` class) are private. They are intended to be accessed only within the class they are defined, not from outside or by subclasses, enforcing data hiding and security.
- **Public Attributes**: Attributes without the double underscore prefix are considered public, meaning they can be freely accessed from outside the class. While the snippet primarily demonstrates private attributes, public attributes would lack the double underscore prefix.

### Inheritance (Implied)

While the code snippet does not directly demonstrate inheritance, it is a fundamental part of OOP. Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass, promoting code reuse. For instance, if there were a `Person` class, `Man` could potentially inherit from it, gaining access to `Person`'s attributes and methods while also defining its own.

### Polymorphism (Implied in Discussion)

Polymorphism allows methods to perform different actions based on the object they are acting upon, even if they share the same name. This is implied through the `area` and `perimeter` methods in both `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes, where the methods perform shape-specific calculations.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is hinted at through the use of instance methods that hide the complexity of calculations from the user. For example, the `area` and `perimeter` methods provide a simple interface to complex operations, allowing the user to obtain this information without knowing the underlying formula.
